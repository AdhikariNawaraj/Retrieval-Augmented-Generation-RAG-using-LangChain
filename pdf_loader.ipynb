In this paper, we propose a\\nnovel attention mechanism for mobile networks by embed-\\nding positional information into channel attention, which\\nwe call “coordinate attention”. Unlike channel attention\\nthat transforms a feature tensor to a single feature vec-\\ntor via 2D global pooling, the coordinate attention factor-\\nizes channel attention into two 1D feature encoding pro-\\ncesses that aggregate features along the two spatial di-\\nrections, respectively. In this way, long-range dependen-\\ncies can be captured along one spatial direction and mean-\\nwhile precise positional information can be preserved along\\nthe other spatial direction. The resulting feature maps are\\nthen encoded separately into a pair of direction-aware and\\nposition-sensitive attention maps that can be complemen-\\ntarily applied to the input feature map to augment the rep-\\nresentations of the objects of interest. Our coordinate at-\\ntention is simple and can be ﬂexibly plugged into classic\\nmobile networks, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNeXt, and\\nEfﬁcientNet with nearly no computational overhead. Exten-\\nsive experiments demonstrate that our coordinate attention\\nis not only beneﬁcial to ImageNet classiﬁcation but more\\ninterestingly, behaves better in down-stream tasks, such as\\nobject detection and semantic segmentation. Code is avail-\\nable at https://github.com/Andrew-Qibin/\\nCoordAttention.\\n1. Introduction\\nAttention mechanisms, used to tell a model “what” and\\n“where” to attend, have been extensively studied [47, 29]\\nand widely deployed for boosting the performance of mod-\\nern deep neural networks [18, 44, 3, 25, 10, 14]. How-\\never, their application for mobile networks (with limited\\nmodel size) signiﬁcantly lags behind that for large networks\\nFigure 1. Performance of different attention methods on three clas-\\nsic vision tasks. The y-axis labels from left to right are top-1 ac-\\ncuracy, mean IoU, and AP, respectively. Clearly, our approach\\nnot only achieves the best result in ImageNet classiﬁcation [33]\\nagainst the SE block [18] and CBAM [44] but performs even better\\nin down-stream tasks, like semantic segmentation [9] and COCO\\nobject detection [21]. Results are based on MobileNetV2 [34].\\n[36, 13, 46]. This is mainly because the computational over-\\nhead brought by most attention mechanisms is not afford-\\nable for mobile networks.\\nConsidering the restricted computation capacity of mo-\\nbile networks, to date, the most popular attention mech-\\nanism for mobile networks is still the Squeeze-and-\\nExcitation (SE) attention [18]. It computes channel atten-\\ntion with the help of 2D global pooling and provides no-\\ntable performance gains at considerably low computational\\ncost. However, the SE attention only considers encoding\\ninter-channel information but neglects the importance of\\npositional information, which is critical to capturing object\\nstructures in vision tasks [42]. Later works, such as BAM\\n[30] and CBAM [44], attempt to exploit positional informa-\\ntion by reducing the channel dimension of the input tensor\\nand then computing spatial attention using convolutions as\\nshown in Figure 2(b). However, convolutions can only cap-\\nture local relations but fail in modeling long-range depen-\\ndencies that are essential for vision tasks [48, 14].\\nIn this paper, beyond the ﬁrst works, we propose a novel\\nand efﬁcient attention mechanism by embedding positional\\ninformation into channel attention to enable mobile net-\\nworks to attend over large regions while avoiding incur-\\nring signiﬁcant computation overhead. To alleviate the po-\\nsitional information loss caused by the 2D global pooling,\\nwe factorize channel attention into two parallel 1D feature\\nencoding processes to effectively integrate spatial coordi-\\narXiv:2103.02907v1  [cs.CV]  4 Mar 2021'),\n",

Speciﬁ-\\ncally, our method exploits two 1D global pooling operations\\nto respectively aggregate the input features along the ver-\\ntical and horizontal directions into two separate direction-\\naware feature maps. These two feature maps with embed-\\nded direction-speciﬁc information are then separately en-\\ncoded into two attention maps, each of which captures long-\\nrange dependencies of the input feature map along one spa-\\ntial direction. The positional information can thus be pre-\\nserved in the generated attention maps. Both attention maps\\nare then applied to the input feature map via multiplication\\nto emphasize the representations of interest. We name the\\nproposed attention method as coordinate attention as its op-\\neration distinguishes spatial direction ( i.e., coordinate) and\\ngenerates coordinate-aware attention maps.\\nOur coordinate attention offers the following advantages.\\nFirst of all, it captures not only cross-channel but also\\ndirection-aware and position-sensitive information, which\\nhelps models to more accurately locate and recognize the\\nobjects of interest. Secondly, our method is ﬂexible and\\nlight-weight, and can be easily plugged into classic build-\\ning blocks of mobile networks, such as the inverted resid-\\nual block proposed in MobileNetV2 [34] and the sandglass\\nblock proposed in MobileNeXt [49], to augment the fea-\\ntures by emphasizing informative representations. Thirdly,\\nas a pretrained model, our coordinate attention can bring\\nsigniﬁcant performance gains to down-stream tasks with\\nmobile networks, especially for those with dense predic-\\ntions (e.g., semantic segmentation), which we will show in\\nour experiment section.\\nTo demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach\\nover previous attention methods for mobile networks, we\\nconduct extensive experiments in both ImageNet classiﬁ-\\ncation [33] and popular down-stream tasks, including ob-\\nject detection and semantic segmentation. With a compa-\\nrable amount of learnable parameters and computation, our\\nnetwork achieves 0.8% performance gain in top-1 classiﬁ-\\ncation accuracy on ImageNet. In object detection and se-\\nmantic segmentation, we also observe signiﬁcant improve-\\nments compared to models with other attention mechanisms\\nas shown in Figure 1. We hope our simple and efﬁcient\\ndesign could facilitate the development of attention mecha-\\nnisms for mobile networks in the future.\\n2. Related Work\\nIn this section, we give a brief literature review of this\\npaper, including prior works on efﬁcient network architec-\\nture design and attention or non-local models.\\n2.1. Mobile Network Architectures\\nRecent state-of-the-art mobile networks are mostly\\nbased on the depthwise separable convolutions [16] and\\nthe inverted residual block [34]. HBONet [20] introduces\\ndown-sampling operations inside each inverted residual\\nblock for modeling the representative spatial information.\\nShufﬂeNetV2 [27] uses a channel split module and a chan-\\nnel shufﬂe module before and after the inverted residual\\nblock. Later, MobileNetV3 [15] combines with neural ar-\\nchitecture search algorithms [50] to search for optimal ac-\\ntivation functions and the expansion ratio of inverted resid-\\nual blocks at different depths. Moreover, MixNet [39], Ef-\\nﬁcientNet [38] and ProxylessNAS [2] also adopt different\\nsearching strategies to search for either the optimal kernel\\nsizes of the depthwise separable convolutions or scalars to\\ncontrol the network weight in terms of expansion ratio, in-\\nput resolution, network depth and width. More recently,\\nZhou et al. [49] rethought the way of exploiting depth-\\nwise separable convolutions and proposed MobileNeXt that\\nadopts a classic bottleneck structure for mobile networks.\\n2.2. Attention Mechanisms\\nAttention mechanisms [41, 40] have been proven helpful\\nin a variety of computer vision tasks, such as image classiﬁ-\\ncation [18, 17, 44, 1] and image segmentation [14, 19, 10].\\nOne of the successful examples is SENet [18], which sim-\\nply squeezes each 2D feature map to efﬁciently build inter-\\ndependencies among channels. CBAM [44] further ad-\\nvances this idea by introducing spatial information encod-\\ning via convolutions with large-size kernels. Later works,\\nlike GENet [17], GALA [22], AA [1], and TA [28], extend\\nthis idea by adopting different spatial attention mechanisms\\nor designing advanced attention blocks.\\nNon-local/self-attention networks are recently very pop-\\nular due to their capability of building spatial or channel-\\nwise attention. Typical examples include NLNet [43], GC-\\nNet [3], A2Net [7], SCNet [25], GSoP-Net [11], or CC-\\nNet [19], all of which exploit non-local mechanisms to cap-\\nture different types of spatial information. However, be-\\ncause of the large amount of computation inside the self-\\nattention modules, they are often adopted in large mod-\\nels [13, 46] but not suitable for mobile networks.\\nDifferent from these approaches that leverage expensive\\nand heavy non-local or self-attention blocks, our approach\\nconsiders a more efﬁcient way of capturing positional in-\\nformation and channel-wise relationships to augment the\\nfeature representations for mobile networks. By factorizing\\nthe 2D global pooling operations into two one-dimensional\\nencoding processes, our approach performs much better\\nthan other attention methods with the lightweight property\\n(e.g., SENet [18], CBAM [44], and TA [28]).\\n3.

To provide a clear description of the pro-\\nposed coordinate attention, we ﬁrst revisit the SE attention,\\nwhich is widely used in mobile networks.\\n3.1. Revisit Squeeze-and-Excitation Attention\\nAs demonstrated in [18], the standard convolution it-\\nself is difﬁcult to model the channel relationships. Explic-\\nitly building channel inter-dependencies can increase the\\nmodel sensitivity to the informative channels that contribute\\nmore to the ﬁnal classiﬁcation decision. Moreover, using\\nglobal average pooling can also assist the model in captur-\\ning global information, which is a lack for convolutions.\\nStructurally, the SE block can be decomposed into two\\nsteps: squeeze and excitation, which are designed for global\\ninformation embedding and adaptive recalibration of chan-\\nnel relationships, respectively. Given the input X, the\\nsqueeze step for the c-th channel can be formulated as fol-\\nlows:\\nzc = 1\\nH×W\\nH∑\\ni=1\\nW∑\\nj=1\\nxc(i,j), (1)\\nwhere zc is the output associated with the c-th channel. The\\ninput X is directly from a convolutional layer with a ﬁxed\\nkernel size and hence can be viewed as a collection of local\\ndescriptors. The squeeze operation makes collecting global\\ninformation possible.\\nThe second step, excitation, aims to fully capture\\nchannel-wise dependencies, which can be formulated as\\nˆX = X ·σ(ˆz), (2)\\nwhere ·refers to channel-wise multiplication, σ is the sig-\\nmoid function, and ˆz is the result generated by a transfor-\\nmation function, which is formulated as follows:\\nˆz = T2(ReLU(T1(z))). (3)\\nHere, T1 and T2 are two linear transformations that can be\\nlearned to capture the importance of each channel.\\nThe SE block has been widely used in recent mobile net-\\nworks [18, 4, 38] and proven to be a key component for\\nachieving state-of-the-art performance. However, it only\\nconsiders reweighing the importance of each channel by\\nmodeling channel relationships but neglects positional in-\\nformation, which as we will prove experimentally in Sec-\\ntion 4 to be important for generating spatially selective at-\\ntention maps. In the following, we introduce a novel at-\\ntention block, which takes into account both inter-channel\\nrelationships and positional information.\\n3.2. Coordinate Attention Blocks\\nOur coordinate attention encodes both channel relation-\\nships and long-range dependencies with precise positional\\ninformation in two steps: coordinate information embed-\\nding and coordinate attention generation. The diagram of\\nthe proposed coordinate attention block can be found in the\\nright part of Figure 2. In the following, we will describe it\\nin detail.\\n3.2.1 Coordinate Information Embedding\\nThe global pooling is often used in channel attention to\\nencode spatial information globally, but it squeezes global\\nspatial information into a channel descriptor and hence is\\ndifﬁcult to preserve positional information, which is essen-\\ntial for capturing spatial structures in vision tasks. To en-\\ncourage attention blocks to capture long-range interactions\\nspatially with precise positional information, we factorize\\nthe global pooling as formulated in Eqn. (1) into a pair of\\n3'),\n",

Speciﬁcally, given the in-\\nput X, we use two spatial extents of pooling kernels (H,1)\\nor (1,W) to encode each channel along the horizontal co-\\nordinate and the vertical coordinate, respectively. Thus, the\\noutput of the c-th channel at height hcan be formulated as\\nzh\\nc (h) = 1\\nW\\n∑\\n0≤i<W\\nxc(h,i).

(5)\\nThe above two transformations aggregate features along\\nthe two spatial directions respectively, yielding a pair of\\ndirection-aware feature maps. This is rather different from\\nthe squeeze operation (Eqn. (1)) in channel attention meth-\\nods that produce a single feature vector. These two transfor-\\nmations also allow our attention block to capture long-range\\ndependencies along one spatial direction and preserve pre-\\ncise positional information along the other spatial direction,\\nwhich helps the networks more accurately locate the objects\\nof interest.\\n3.2.2 Coordinate Attention Generation\\nAs described above, Eqn. (4) and Eqn. (5) enable a global\\nreceptive ﬁeld and encode precise positional information.\\nTo take advantage of the resulting expressive representa-\\ntions, we present the second transformation, termed coordi-\\nnate attention generation. Our design refers to the following\\nthree criteria. First of all, the new transformation should be\\nas simple and cheap as possible regarding the applications\\nin mobile environments. Second, it can make full use of the\\ncaptured positional information so that the regions of inter-\\nest can be accurately highlighted. Last but not the least, it\\nshould also be able to effectively capture inter-channel rela-\\ntionships, which has been demonstrated essential in existing\\nstudies [18, 44].\\nSpeciﬁcally, given the aggregated feature maps produced\\nby Eqn. 4 and Eqn. 5, we ﬁrst concatenate them and then\\nsend them to a shared 1 ×1 convolutional transformation\\nfunction F1, yielding\\nf = δ(F1([zh,zw])), (6)\\nwhere [·,·] denotes the concatenation operation along the\\nspatial dimension, δis a non-linear activation function and\\nf ∈RC/r×(H+W) is the intermediate feature map that en-\\ncodes spatial information in both the horizontal direction\\nand the vertical direction.

Another two 1 ×1 con-\\nvolutional transformations Fh and Fw are utilized to sepa-\\nrately transform fh and fw to tensors with the same channel\\nnumber to the input X, yielding\\ngh = σ(Fh(fh)), (7)\\ngw = σ(Fw(fw)). (8)\\nRecall that σ is the sigmoid function. To reduce the over-\\nhead model complexity, we often reduce the channel num-\\nber of f with an appropriate reduction ratio r(e.g., 32). We\\nwill discuss the impact of different reduction ratios on the\\nperformance in our experiment section. The outputs gh and\\ngw are then expanded and used as attention weights, respec-\\ntively. Finally, the output of our coordinate attention block\\nY can be written as\\nyc(i,j) =xc(i,j) ×gh\\nc (i) ×gw\\nc (j). (9)\\nDiscussion. Unlike channel attention that only focuses on\\nreweighing the importance of different channels, our coor-\\ndinate attention block also considers encoding the spatial\\ninformation. As described above, the attention along both\\nthe horizontal and vertical directions is simultaneously ap-\\nplied to the input tensor. Each element in the two attention\\nmaps reﬂects whether the object of interest exists in the cor-\\nresponding row and column. This encoding process allows\\nour coordinate attention to more accurately locate the exact\\nposition of the object of interest and hence helps the whole\\nmodel to recognize better.

Experiments\\nIn this section, we ﬁrst describe our experiment settings\\nand then conduct a series of ablation experiments to demon-\\nstrate the contribution of each component in the proposed\\ncoordinate attention to the performance. Next, we compare\\nour approach with some attention based methods. Finally,\\nwe report the results of the proposed approach compared to\\nother attention based methods on object detection and se-\\nmantic segmentation.\\n4.1. Experiment Setup\\nWe use the PyTorch toolbox [31] to implement all our\\nexperiments. During training, we use the standard SGD op-\\ntimizer with decay and momentum of 0.9 to train all the\\nmodels. The weight decay is set to 4 ×10−5 always. The\\ncosine learning schedule with an initial learning rate of 0.05\\nis adopted. We use four NVIDIA GPUs for training and the\\nbatch size is set to 256. Without extra declaration, we take\\nMobileNetV2 as our baseline and train all the models for\\n200 epochs. For data augmentation, we use the same meth-\\nods as in MobileNetV2. We report results on the ImageNet\\ndataset [33] in classiﬁcation.\\n4.2. Ablation Studies\\nImportance of coordinate attention. To demonstrate the\\nperformance of the proposed coordinate attention, we per-\\nform a series of ablation experiments, the corresponding re-\\nsults of which are all listed in Table 1. We remove either the\\nhorizontal attention or the vertical attention from the coordi-\\nnate attention to see the importance of encoding coordinate\\ninformation. As shown in Table 1, the model with atten-\\ntion along either direction has comparable performance to\\nTable 2.

However, when both the hor-\\nizontal attention and the vertical attention are incorporated,\\nwe obtain the best result as highlighted in Table 1. These ex-\\nperiments reﬂect that with comparable learnable parameters\\nand computational cost, coordinate information embedding\\nis more helpful for image classiﬁcation.\\nDifferent weight multipliers. Here, we take two clas-\\nsic mobile networks (including MobileNetV2 [34] with in-\\nverted residual blocks and MobileNeXt [49] with sandglass\\nbottleneck block) as baselines to see the performance of\\nthe proposed approach compared to the SE attention [18]\\nand CBAM [44] under different weight multipliers. In this\\nexperiment, we adopt three typical weight multipliers, in-\\ncluding {1.0,0.75,0.5}. As shown in Table 2, when taking\\nthe MobileNetV2 network as baseline, models with CBAM\\nhave similar results to those with the SE attention. However,\\nmodels with the proposed coordinate attention yield the best\\nresults under each setting. Similar phenomenon can also be\\nobserved when the MobileNeXt network is used as listed in\\nTable 3. This indicates that no matter which of the sandglass\\nbottleneck block or the inverted residual block is considered\\nand no matter which weight multiplier is selected, our coor-\\ndinate attention performs the best because of the advanced\\nway to encode positional and inter-channel information si-\\nmultaneously.\\nThe impact of reduction ratio r. To investigate the im-\\npact of different reduction ratios of attention blocks on the\\nmodel performance, we attempt to decrease the size of the\\nreduction ratio and see the performance change. As shown\\nin Table 4, when we reducerto half of the original size, the\\nmodel size increases but better performance can be yielded.\\nThis demonstrates that adding more parameters by reducing\\nthe reduction ratio matters for improving the model perfor-\\nmance.

As can be seen,\\nadding the SE attention has already raised the classiﬁcation\\nperformance by more than 1%.

Applications\\nIn this subsection, we conduct experiments on both the\\nobject detection task and the semantic segmentation task to\\nexplore the transferable capability of the proposed coordi-\\nnate attention against other attention methods.\\n4.4.1 Object Detection\\nImplementation Details. Our code is based on PyTorch\\nand SSDLite [34, 26]. Following [34], we connect the ﬁrst\\nand second layers of SSDLite to the last pointwise convo-\\nlutions with output stride of 16 and 32, respectively and\\nadd the rest SSDLite layers on top of the last convolutional\\nlayer. When training on COCO, we set the batch size to\\n256 and use the synchronized batch normalization. The co-\\nsine learning schedule is used with an initial learning rate of\\n0.01. We train the models for totally 1,600,000 iterations.\\nWhen training on Pascal VOC, the batch size is set to 24\\nand all the models are trained for 240,000 iterations. The\\nweight decay is set to 0.9. The initial learning rate is 0.001,\\nwhich is then divided by 10 at 160,000 and again at 200,000\\niterations. For other settings, readers can refer to [34, 26].\\nResults on COCO. In this experiment, we follow most pre-\\nvious work and report results in terms of AP, AP 50, AP75,\\nAPS, APM , and APL, respectively. In Table 6, we show the\\nresults produced by different network settings on the COCO\\n2017 validation set. It is obvious that adding coordinate at-\\ntention into MobileNetV2 substantially improve the detec-\\ntion results (24.5 v.s. 22.3) with only 0.5M parameters over-\\nhead and nearly the same computational cost. Compared to\\nother light-weight attention methods, such as the SE atten-\\ntion and CBAM, our version of SSDLite320 achieves the\\nbest results in all metrics with nearly the same number of\\nparameters and computations.\\nMoreover, we also show results produced by previous\\nstate-of-the-art models based on SSDLite320 as listed in Ta-\\nble 6. Note that some methods (e.g., MobileNetV3 [15] and\\nMnasNet-A1 [37]) are based on neural architecture search\\nmethods but our model does not. Obviously, our detection\\nmodel achieves the best results in terms of AP compared to\\nother approaches with close parameters and computations.\\nResults on Pascal VOC. In Table 7, we show the detection\\nresults on Pascal VOC 2007 test set when different atten-\\ntion methods are adopted. We observe that the SE attention\\nand CBAM cannot improve the baseline results. However,\\nadding the proposed coordinate attention can largely raise\\nthe mean AP from 71.7 to 73.1. Both detection experiments\\non COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate that classi-\\nﬁcation models with the proposed coordinate attention have\\nbetter transferable capability compared to those with other\\nattention methods.\\n4.4.2 Semantic Segmentation\\nWe also conduct experiments on semantic segmenta-\\ntion. Following MobileNetV2 [34], we utilize the classic\\nDeepLabV3 [6] as an example and compare the proposed\\napproach with other models to demonstrate the transferable\\ncapability of the proposed coordinate attention in semantic\\nsegmentation. Speciﬁcally, we discard the last linear opera-\\ntor and connect the ASPP to the last convolutional operator.\\nWe replace the standard 3 ×3 convolutional operators with\\nthe depthwise separable convolutions in the ASPP to reduce\\nthe model size considering mobile applications. The output\\nchannels for each branch in ASPP are set to 256 and other\\ncomponents in the ASPP are kept unchanged (including the\\n1×1 convolution branch and the image-level feature encod-\\ning branch). We report results on two widely used semantic\\nsegmentation benchmarks, including Pascal VOC 2012 [9]\\nand Cityscapes [8]. For experiment settings, we strictly fol-\\nlow the DeeplabV3 paper except for the weight decay that is\\nset to 4e-5. When the output stride is set to 16, the dilation\\nrates in the ASPP are {6, 12, 18}while {12, 24, 36}when\\nthe output stride is set to 8.\\nResults on Pascal VOC 2012. The Pascal VOC 2012 seg-\\nmentation benchmark has totally 21 classes including one\\nbackground class. As suggested by the original paper, we\\nuse the split with 1,464 images for training and the split\\nwith 1,449 images for validation. Also, as done in most\\nprevious work [6, 5], we augment the training set by adding\\nextra images from [12], resulting in totally 10,582 images\\nfor training.\\nWe show the segmentation results when taking differ-\\nent models as backbones in Table 8.

In previous transformer-\\nbased detectors, the object queries are a set of learned em-\\nbeddings. However, each learned embedding does not have\\nan explicit physical meaning and we cannot explain where\\nit will focus on. It is difﬁcult to optimize as the prediction\\nslot of each object query does not have a speciﬁc mode. In\\nother words, each object query will not focus on a speciﬁc\\nregion. To solve these problems, in our query design, object\\nqueries are based on anchor points, which are widely used\\nin CNN-based detectors. So each object query focuses on\\nthe objects near the anchor point. Moreover, our query de-\\nsign can predict multiple objects at one position to solve the\\ndifﬁculty: “one region, multiple objects”. In addition, we de-\\nsign an attention variant, which can reduce the memory cost\\nwhile achieving similar or better performance than the stan-\\ndard attention in DETR. Thanks to the query design and the\\nattention variant, the proposed detector that we called Anchor\\nDETR, can achieve better performance and run faster than\\nthe DETR with 10\\x02 fewer training epochs. For example, it\\nachieves 44.2 AP with 19 FPS on the MSCOCO dataset when\\nusing the ResNet50-DC5 feature for training 50 epochs. Ex-\\ntensive experiments on the MSCOCO benchmark prove the\\neffectiveness of the proposed methods. Code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/megvii-research/AnchorDETR.\\nIntroduction\\nThe object detection task is to predict a bounding box and a\\ncategory for each object of interest in an image. In the last\\ndecades, there are many great progresses in object detection\\nbased on the CNN (Ren et al. 2015; Cai and Vasconcelos\\n2018; Redmon et al. 2016; Lin et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2020;\\nQiao, Chen, and Yuille 2020; Chen et al. 2021). Recently,\\nCarion et al. (Carion et al. 2020) propose the DETR which\\nis a new paradigm of object detection based on the trans-\\nformer. It uses a set of learned object queries to reason about\\nthe relations of the objects and the global image context to\\noutput the ﬁnal predictions set. However, the learned object\\nquery is very hard to explain. It does not have an explicit\\nphysical meaning and the corresponding prediction slots of\\neach object query do not have a speciﬁc mode.

The results\\nare based on the ResNet-50 backbone and “DC5” means the\\ndilated C5 feature. The DETR is trained with 500 epochs\\nwhile the others are trained with 50 epochs. We evaluate\\nthe FPS of the proposed detector by following the script in\\nDETR and set the batch size to 1 for a fair comparison with\\nothers. Note that we follow the DETR to script the model to\\nevaluate the speed.\\ncode the anchor points as the object queries. The object\\nqueries are the encodings of anchor points’ coordinates so\\nthat each object query has an explicit physical meaning.\\nHowever, this solution will encounter difﬁculty: there will be\\nmultiple objects appearing in one position. In this situation,\\nonly one object query in this position cannot predict multi-\\nple objects, so the object queries from other positions have\\nto predict these objects collaboratively. It will cause each ob-\\nject query to be in charge of a larger area. Thus, we improve\\nthe object query design by adding multiple patterns to each\\nanchor point so that each anchor point can predict multiple\\nobjects. As shown in Figure 1(b), all the predictions of the\\nthree patterns of each object query are distributed around the\\ncorresponding anchor point. In other words, it demonstrates\\nthat each object query only focuses on the objects near the\\ncorresponding anchor point. So the proposed object query\\ncan be easy to explain. As the object query has a speciﬁc\\nmode and does not need to predict the object far away from\\nthe corresponding position, it can easier to optimize.\\nBesides the query design, we also design an attention vari-\\nant that we call Row-Column Decouple Attention (RCDA).\\nIt decouples the 2D key feature into the 1D row feature and\\nthe 1D column feature, then conducts the row attention and\\ncolumn attention successively. The RCDA can reduce the\\nmemory cost while achieving similar or better performance\\nthan the standard attention in DETR. We believe it can be a\\ngood alternative to the standard attention in DETR.\\nAs shown in Table 1, thanks to the novel query design\\nbased on the anchor point and the attention variant, the\\nproposed detector Anchor DETR can achieve better perfor-\\nmance and run faster than the original DETR with even 10\\x02\\nfewer training epochs when using the same single-level fea-\\nture. Compared with other DETR-like detectors with 10\\x02\\nfewer training epochs, the proposed detector achieves the\\nbest performance among them. The proposed detector can\\nachieve 44.2 AP with 19 FPS when using a single ResNet50-\\nDC5 (He et al. 2016) feature for training 50 epochs.\\nThe main contributions can be summarized as:\\n• We propose a novel query design based on anchor points\\nfor the transformer-based detectors. Moreover, we attach\\nmultiple patterns to each anchor point so that it can pre-\\ndict multiple objects for each position to deal with the\\ndifﬁculty: “one region, multiple objects”. The proposed\\nquery based on the anchor point is more explainable and\\neasier to optimize than the learned embedding. Thanks to\\nthe effectiveness of the proposed query design, our detec-\\ntor can achieve better performance with 10\\x02fewer train-\\ning epochs than the DETR.\\n• We design an attention variant that we called Row-\\nColumn Decoupled Attention. It can reduce the memory\\ncost while achieving similar or better performance than\\nthe standard attention in DETR, which can be a good al-\\nternative to standard attention.\\n• Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the effec-\\ntiveness of each component.\\nRelated Work\\nAnchors in Object Detection\\nThere are two type of anchors used in CNN-based object\\ndetectors, i.e. anchor boxes (Ren et al. 2015; Lin et al.\\n2017) and anchor points (Tian et al. 2019; Zhou, Wang, and\\nKr¨ahenb¨uhl 2019). As the hand-craft anchor boxes need to\\nbe carefully tuned to achieve good performance, we may\\nprefer to not use the anchor boxes. We usually treat the\\nanchor-free as the anchor boxes free so that the detectors\\nusing anchor point also be treated as anchor-free (Tian et al.\\n2019; Zhou, Wang, and Kr ¨ahenb¨uhl 2019). DETR (Carion\\net al. 2020) adopt neither the anchor boxes nor the anchor\\npoints. It directly predicts the absolute position of each ob-\\nject in the image. However, we ﬁnd that introducing the an-\\nchor point into the object query can be better.\\nTransformer Detector\\nCarion et al. (Carion et al. 2020) propose the DETR which\\nis based on the transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) for ob-\\nject detection. The transformer detector will feed the in-\\nformation of value to the query based on the similarity of\\nthe query and key. Zhu et al. (Zhu et al. 2021) propose the\\nDeformable DETR that samples information of deformable\\npoints around the reference points to the query and applies\\nmultiple level features to solve the slowly converge speed\\nof the transformer detector. The reference points are simi-\\nlar to the anchor points but the object queries of it are still\\nthe learned embeddings. It predicts the reference points by\\nthe object queries rather than encoding the anchor points as\\nthe object queries. Gao et al. (Gao et al. 2021) add a Gaus-\\nsian map in the original attention for each query. Concurrent\\nwith us, the Conditional DETR (Meng et al. 2021) encodes\\nthe reference point as the query position embedding. But the\\nmotivations are different so that it only uses the reference\\npoint to generate position embedding as the conditional spa-\\ntial embedding in the cross attention and the object queries\\nare still the learned embeddings. Besides, it does not involve\\nthe multiple predictions of one position and the attention\\nvariants.\\nEfﬁcient Attention\\nThe self-attention of the transformer has high complexity so\\nit cannot well deal with a very large number of queries and\\n2568'),\n",

To solve this problem, many efﬁcient attention mod-\\nules have been proposed (Shen et al. 2021; Vaswani et al.\\n2017; Beltagy, Peters, and Cohan 2020; Liu et al. 2021; Ma\\net al. 2021). One method is to compute the key and value\\nﬁrst which can lead to linear complexity of the number of\\nthe query or key. The Efﬁcient Attention (Shen et al. 2021)\\nand the Linear Attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) follow\\nthis idea. Another method is to restrict the attention region\\nof the key for each query instead of the whole region. The\\nRestricted Self-Attention (Vaswani et al. 2017), Deformable\\nAttention (Zhu et al. 2021), Criss-Cross Attention (Huang\\net al. 2019), and LongFormer (Beltagy, Peters, and Cohan\\n2020) follow this idea. In this paper, we decouple the key\\nfeature to the row feature and the column feature by 1D\\nglobal average pooling and then perform the row attention\\nand the column attention successively.\\nMethod\\nAnchor Points\\nIn the CNN-based detectors, anchor points always are the\\ncorresponding position of the feature maps. But it can be\\nmore ﬂexible in the transformer-based detector. The anchor\\npoints can be the learned points, the uniform grid points,\\nor other hand-craft anchor points. We adopt two types of an-\\nchor points. One is the grid anchor points and the other is the\\nlearned anchor points. As shown in Figure 2(a), the gird an-\\nchor points are ﬁxed as the uniform grid points in the image.\\nThe learned points are randomly initialized with uniform\\ndistribution from 0 to 1 and updated as the learned parame-\\nters. With the anchor points, the center position ( ^cx; ^cy) of\\nthe predicted bounding box will be based on the correspond-\\ning anchor point like that in the Deformable DETR (Zhu\\net al. 2021).\\nAttention Formulation\\nThe attention of DETR-like transformer can be formulate as:\\nAttention(Q; K; V) = softmax(QKT\\npdk\\n)V;\\nQ = Qf + Qp; K= Kf + Kp; V= Vf ;\\n(1)\\nwhere the dk is the channel dimension, the subscript f\\nmeans the feature, and the subscript p means the position\\nembedding. The Q, K, V are the query, key, value respec-\\ntively. Note that the Q, K, V will pass through a linear layer\\nrespectively and that is omitted in Equation (1) for clarity.\\nThere are two attentions in the DETR decoder. One is\\nself-attention and the other is cross-attention. In the self-\\nattention, the Kf and the Vf are the same as the Qf while\\nthe Kp is the same as the Qp. The Qf 2RNq× C is the out-\\nput of last decoder and the initial Qinit\\nf 2RNq× C for the\\nﬁrst decoder can be set to a constant vector or learned em-\\nbedding. For the query position embeddingQp 2RNq× C, it\\nuses a set of learned embedding in DETR:\\nQp = Embedding(Nq; C): (2)\\nIn the cross-attention, the Qf 2 RNq× C is generated\\nfrom the output of the self-attention in front while the Kf 2\\nRHW × C and Vf 2RHW × C are the output feature of the en-\\ncoder. The Kp 2RHW × C is the position embedding of Kf .\\nIt is generated by the sine-cosine position encoding func-\\ntion (Vaswani et al. 2017; Carion et al. 2020) gsin based on\\nthe corresponding key feature position Posk 2RHW × 2:\\nKp = gsin(Posk): (3)\\nNote that the H; W; Cis the height, width, channel of the\\nfeature and the Nq is the predeﬁned number of the query.\\nAnchor Points to Object Query\\nUsually, the Qp in decoder is regarded as the object query\\nbecause it is responsible for distinguishing different objects.\\nThe object query of learned embedding like Equation (2) is\\nhard to explain as discussed in the Introduction section.\\nIn this paper, we propose to design the object query based\\non the anchor point Posq. The Posq 2RNA× 2 represents\\nNA points with their (x; y) positions which range from 0\\nto 1. Then the object query based on the anchor points can\\nformulate as:\\nQp = Encode(Posq): (4)\\nIt means that we encode the anchor points as the object\\nqueries.\\nSo how to design the encoding function? As the object\\nquery is designed as the query position embedding as shown\\nin Equation (1), the most natural way is to share the same\\nposition encoding function as key:\\nQp = g(Posq); Kp = g(Posk); (5)\\nwhere g is the position encoding function. The position en-\\ncoding function could be the gsin or other position encoding\\nfunctions. In this paper, instead of just using the heuristic\\ngsin, we prefer to use a small MLP network with two linear\\nlayers to adapt it additionally.\\nMultiple Predictions for Each Anchor Point\\nTo deal with the situation that one position may have mul-\\ntiple objects, we further improve the object query to pre-\\ndict multiple objects for each anchor point instead of just\\none prediction. Reviewing the initial query feature Qinit\\nf 2\\nRNq× C, each of the Nq object queries has one pattern Qi\\nf 2\\nR1× C, where the i is the index of object queries. To predict\\n2569'),\n",

We use a small set\\npattern embedding Qi\\nf 2RNp× C:\\nQi\\nf = Embedding(Np; C); (6)\\nto detect objects with different patterns at each position. The\\nNp is the number of pattern which is very small, e.g. Np =\\n3. For the property of translation invariance, the patterns are\\nshared for all the object queries. Thus we can get the initial\\nQinit\\nf 2 RNpNA× C and Qp 2 RNpNA× C by sharing the\\nQi\\nf 2RNp× C to each of the Qp 2RNA× C. Here the Nq is\\nequal to Np \\x02NA. Then we can deﬁne the proposed Pattern-\\nPosition query design as:\\nQ = Qinit\\nf + Qp: (7)\\nFor the following decoder, theQf is also generated from the\\noutput of last decoder like DETR.\\nThanks to the proposed query design, the proposed de-\\ntector has an interpretable query and achieves better per-\\nformance than the original DETR with 10\\x02 fewer training\\nepochs.\\nRow-Column Decoupled Attention\\nThe transformer will cost a lot of GPU memory which may\\nlimit its use of the high-resolution feature or other exten-\\nsions. The Deformable Transformer (Zhu et al. 2021) can\\nreduce memory cost but it will lead to random access of\\nmemory which may not be friendly to modern accelerators\\nof massive parallelism. There are also some attention mod-\\nules (Ma et al. 2021; Shen et al. 2021) with linear complexity\\nand will not lead to random access of memory. However, in\\nour experiments, we ﬁnd that these attention modules cannot\\nwell deal with the DETR-like detectors. It may be because\\nthe cross-attention in the decoder is much more difﬁcult than\\nthe self-attention.\\nIn this paper, we propose the Row-Column Decoupled\\nAttention (RCDA) which can not only decrease the mem-\\nory burdens but also achieve similar or better performance\\nthan the standard attention in DETR. The main idea of the\\nRCDA is to decouple the 2D key feature Kf 2RH× W× C\\nto 1D row feature Kf;x 2RW× C and 1D column feature\\nKf;y 2RH× C, then perform the row attention and the col-\\numn attention successively. We choose the 1D global aver-\\nage pooling to decouple the key feature by default. Without\\nlosing generality, we hypothesize W \\x15H and the RCDA\\ncan be formulated as:\\nAx = softmax(QxKT\\nx\\npdk\\n); Ax 2RNq× W ;\\nZ = weightedsumW(Ax; V); Z2RNq× H× C;\\nAy = softmax(QyKT\\nypdk\\n); Ay 2RNq× H;\\nOut = weightedsumH(Ay; Z); Out2RNq× C;\\n(8)\\nwhere\\nQx = Qf + Qp;x; Qy = Qf + Qp;y;\\nQp;x = g1D(Posq;x); Qp;y = g1D(Posq;y);\\nKx = Kf;x + Kp;x; Ky = Kf;y + Kp;y; (9)\\nKp;x = g1D(Posk;x); Kp;y = g1D(Posk;y);\\nV = Vf ; V 2RH× W× C:\\nThe weighted sumW and weighted sumH operations con-\\nduct the weighted sum along the width dimension and the\\nheight dimension respectively. The Posq;x 2 RNq× 1 is\\nthe corresponding row position of Qf 2 RNq× C and the\\nPosq;y 2RNq× 1, Posk;x 2RW× 1, Posk;y 2RH× 1 are\\nin the similar manner. The g1D is the 1D position encoding\\nfunction which is similar to g and it will encode a 1D coor-\\ndinate to a vector with C channels.\\nNow we analyze why it can save the memory. We hypoth-\\nesize the head number M of multi-head attention to 1 for\\nclarity in the previous formulation without losing general-\\nity, but we should consider the head number M for mem-\\nory analysis.

The\\nattention weight map of RCDA is Ax 2 RNq× W× M and\\nAy 2RNq× H× M whose memory cost is much smaller than\\nthe A. However, the major memory cost in the RCDA is the\\ntemporary result Z. So we should compare the memory cost\\nof A 2RNq× H× W× M and Z 2RNq× H× C. The ratio for\\nsaving memory of the RCDA is:\\nr = (Nq \\x02H \\x02W \\x02M)=(Nq \\x02H \\x02C)\\n= W \\x02M=C (10)\\nwhere the default setting is M = 8; C= 256. So the mem-\\nory cost is roughly the same when the large side W is equal\\nto 32 which is a typical value for the C5 feature in object de-\\ntection. When using the high-resolution feature it can save\\nthe memory, e.g saving roughly 2x memory for the C4 or\\nDC5 feature and saving 4x memory for the C3 feature.\\nExperiment\\nImplementation Details\\nWe conduct the experiments on the MS COCO (Lin et al.\\n2014) benchmark. All models are trained on the train2017\\nsplit and evaluated on the val2017. The models are trained\\non 8 GPUs with 1 image per GPU. We train our model\\non the training set for 50 epochs with the AdamW opti-\\nmizer (Loshchilov and Hutter 2019) setting the initial learn-\\ning rate to 10− 5 for the backbone and 10− 4 for the others.\\nThe learning rate will be decayed by a factor of 0.1 at the\\n40th epoch. We set the weight decay to10− 4 and the dropout\\nrate to 0 (i.e. remove dropout). The head for the attention is\\n8, the attention feature channel is 256 and the hidden di-\\nmension of the feed-forward network is 1024. We choose\\nthe number of anchor points to 300 and the number of pat-\\nterns to 3 by default. We use a set of learned points as anchor\\npoints by default.

The “C5” and “DC5” mean that the detector uses a\\nsingle C5 or dilated C5 feature while the other detectors use\\nmultiple-level features. Using multiple-level features usu-\\nally will have a better performance but cost more resources.\\nSurprisingly, our detector with a single DC5 feature can\\nachieve better performance than the Deformable DETR and\\nSCMA which use multiple-level features. The proposed de-\\ntector can achieve better performance than DETR with 10\\x02\\nfewer training epochs. It proves the proposed query design\\nis very effective.\\nWe also show the property of anchor-free, NMS-free, and\\nRAM-free for each detector in Table 2. The anchor-free and\\nNMS-free indicate the detector does not need the hand-craft\\nanchor box and non-maximum suppression. The RAM-free\\nmeans the detector will not involve any random access of\\nmemory which can be very friendly to modern accelerators\\nin practice. The two-stage detectors always are not RAM-\\nfree because the region of interest (RoI) is stochastic to\\nthe hardware and the operation of the RoI-Align (He et al.\\n2017)/RoI-Pooling (Girshick 2015) will involve the random\\naccess of memory. The Deformable DETR is similar to the\\ntwo-stage detector as the position of the sample point is\\nstochastic to the hardware so that it is not RAM-free. On\\nthe contrary, the proposed detector inherits the properties of\\nanchor-free, NMS-free, and RAM-free from the DETR with\\nan improvement of performance and fewer training epochs.\\nAblation Study\\nEffectiveness of each component Table 3 shows the ef-\\nfectiveness of each component that we proposed.

We\\nthink it is slightly easier to optimize as the attention map\\nis smaller than the standard attention.

The\\nobject query based on anchor points with a single prediction\\nhas 2.3 AP improvements and the multiple predictions for\\neach anchor point can have 1.6 further improvements. Ap-\\nplying the multiple predictions to the original object query\\nin DETR will not improve the performance. It is because the\\noriginal object query is not highly related to the position thus\\nit cannot get beneﬁts from the “one region, multiple predic-\\ntions”.\\nMultiple Predictions for Each Anchor Point Table 4\\nshows that multiple predictions for each anchor point play\\nan essential role in query design. For a single prediction (1\\npattern), we ﬁnd that 100 anchor points are not good enough\\nand 900 anchor points get similar performance as 300 an-\\nchor points, thus we use 300 anchor points by default. The\\nmultiple predictions (3 patterns) can outperform the single\\nprediction (1 pattern) by 2.6 and 1.6 AP for 100 and 300\\nanchor points respectively. With the same number of the\\npredictions, the multiple predictions for each anchor point\\n(300 anchor points, 3 patterns) can outperform the single\\nprediction (900 anchor points, 1 pattern) for 1.3 AP. It indi-\\ncates that the improvements of multiple predictions do not\\ncome from the increased number of predictions. These re-\\nsults prove the effectiveness of multiple predictions for each\\nanchor point.\\nAnchor Points Types We have tried two types of anchor\\npoints, i.e., the grid anchor points and the learned anchor\\npoints. As shown in Figure 2, the learned anchor points dis-\\ntribute uniformly in the image which is similar to the grid\\nanchor points. We hypothesize that this is because the ob-\\njects distribute everywhere in large COCO data set. We also\\nﬁnd the grid anchor points can achieve similar performance\\nas the learned anchor points in Table 5.\\nPrediction Slots of Object Query As shown in Fig-\\nure 1(b), we can observe that the prediction slots of each\\nobject query in the proposed detector will focus on the ob-\\njects near the corresponding anchor point. As there are three\\npatterns for the anchor points, we also show the histogram of\\neach pattern in Figure 4. We ﬁnd that the patterns are related\\nto the object size as the large boxes usually appear in pattern\\n(a) while pattern (b) focuses on the small objects. But the\\nquery patterns do not just depend on the size of the object\\nbecause the small boxes can also appear in the pattern (a).\\nWe think it is because there are more small objects, and mul-\\ntiple small objects are more likely to appear in one region.\\nSo all the patterns will be in charge of the small objects.\\nRow-Column Decoupled Attention As shown in Table 6,\\nwe compare the Row-Column Decoupled Attention with\\nthe standard attention in DETR and some efﬁcient attention\\nmodules with linear complexity. The attention modules with\\nlinear complexity can signiﬁcantly reduce the training mem-\\nory compared to the standard attention module. However,\\ntheir performance drops signiﬁcantly. It may be because the\\ncross-attention in the DETR-like detectors is much more\\ndifﬁcult than the self-attention. On the contrary, the Row-\\nColumn Decoupled Attention can achieve similar perfor-\\nmance. As previously discussed, the Row-Column Decou-\\npled Attention can signiﬁcantly reduce memory when using\\nthe high-resolution feature and get roughly the same mem-\\nory cost when using the C5 feature. For example, RCDA\\nreduces the training memory from 10.5G to 4.4G and gets\\nthe same performance as the standard attention when using\\nthe DC5 feature. In conclusion, the Row-Column Decoupled\\nAttention can be efﬁcient in memory while preserving com-\\npetitive performance so that it can be a good alternative to\\nthe standard attention in DETR.\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper, we propose a detector based on the trans-\\nformer. We propose a novel query design based on the an-\\nchor point that has explicit physical meaning. The corre-\\nsponding prediction slots can have a speciﬁc mode, i.e. the\\npredictions are near the anchor point, so that it is easier\\nto optimize. Moreover, we incorporate multiple patterns to\\neach anchor point to solve the difﬁculty: “one region, multi-\\nple objects”. We also propose an attention variant named the\\nRow-Column Decoupled Attention. The Row-Column De-\\ncouple Attention can reduce the memory cost while achiev-\\ning similar or better performance than the standard attention\\nin DETR. The proposed detector can run faster and achieve\\nbetter performance with 10\\x02fewer training epochs than the\\nDETR. The proposed detector is an end-to-end detector with\\nthe property of anchor-free, NMS-free, and RAM-free. We\\nhope the proposed detector can be useful in practice and be\\na strong simple baseline for research.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis paper is supported by the National Key R&D Plan\\nof the Ministry of Science and Technology (Project No.\\n2573'),\n",
